# CST – Lab 1 & Lab 2  
This repository contains the practical work for the CST (Computer Systems & Technologies) module in the 9-Month Professional Training Program at ITI.  
Specifically, it includes the Lab 1 and Lab 2 exercises combining HTML & CSS.

## ✅ Contents  
- `home.html` – Main landing page.  
- `main.html` – Secondary page (layout continuation).  
- `login.html` – User login form.  
- `registration.html` – User registration form.  
- `contact.html` – Contact page.  
- `main.css` – Global styling file.  
- `lab2.css` – Specific CSS rules for Lab 2 exercises.  
- Images (e.g., `mail.png`, `socialmedia.png`, `welcome.gif`) used in the pages.  
- Repository is structured in a **single folder** (not separate folders for each lab) for simplicity.

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Apply HTML structure and semantics (headings, forms, input fields, links, etc.).  
2. Use CSS for styling, layout, responsiveness basics, and visual design.  
3. Combine these skills to build a small set of web-pages reflecting the coursework of Lab 1 & Lab 2.

## 📌 Notes  
- The project is built using **HTML (≈ 93 %)** and **CSS (≈ 7 %)** as revealed by GitHub language stats.  
- No JavaScript or backend components — the focus is purely on front-end fundamentals for this module.  
- You can view the pages directly in browser by opening the `.html` files.  
- For future work, consider organising further labs into folders if they grow in size or number.
